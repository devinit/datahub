# DataHub - Next

This is just primarily the frontend part of the DataHub, to keep things modular the backend will be in a separate repo.

## How to use

--------

Install it and run:

```bash
npm install --ignore-scripts & npm install -g flow-typed # dont install with yarn see  Known development issues below
npm run dev
```

## Development guidelines

-----------

Create a branch for which ever issue you are working on. After you are done create and submit a pull request to the master branch.
Before merging your pull request make sure the build passes on travis-ci
if you have linting errors consider running

```
npm run format
```

## [Buiding on top of next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js)


- The file system is your routes. Drop a new file in pages and it becomes a route
- Automatic code splitting at route level
- Does away with a lot of tooling configuration boilerplate

[if you are wondering why the file structure is so flat, checkout this linked next.js issue](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/issues/91)

## Flow for types

[On why we chose flow for types](https://djcordhose.github.io/flow-vs-typescript/2016_hhjs.html)

 #### Making flow work well with external libraries
In oder to get the best out of flow we need type information for external libraries.
Flow helps with it through the [flow-typed](https://github.com/flowtype/flow-typed) tool
  >
  - ```$ npm install -g flow-typed``` (if not installed already)
  - ```$ flow-typed install ``` -- this installs all the flow type definitions relative to the project
  - when you add a new Dependency add its types as follows
  -  ```$ flow-typed install rxjs@5.0.x ```

There are dependencies for which flow-typed has no definitions for those have a look at [flowgen](https://github.com/joarwilk/flowgen) which offers away of transpiling typescript definitions to flow definitions.

If the above options arent viable consider generating a stub for the types as below
```
flow-typed create-stub @devinit/charts@1.1.4
```



## State management and data fetching with [apollo](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client) and [redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux)
- Apollo graphql integration takes away a lot of data fetching boilerplate commonly found in react apps.
- Apollo graphql also allows for efficient data fetching through fewer network requests.

## [Atomic react design component development](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) with [storybook](https://storybooks.js.org/)

## Testing with [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/)

## Styling with [semantic UI](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI-React) and [glamorous](https://github.com/paypal/glamorous)

## [Offline access (PWA) with service worker](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) and [localForage](https://github.com/localForage/localForage)

## On Maps

--------

We use a mapbox-gl 

## Deployments handled by Now for staging and test previews

--------

Deploy it to the cloud with [now](https://zeit.co/now) ([download](https://zeit.co/download)):

``` bash
now
```
Ask Allan for latest staging url

## Deployment for production
cd into root of the project
``` bash
  $ docker build -t datahub-2 .
  $ docker run -it -d -p 7777:4040 --name datahub-2-app datahub-2
```

## Graphql types

Package.json has a ```qql-schema``` command in which you put a graphql api endpoint. This endpoint is used in the command to create a schema.json file which is used by the ```gql-flow``` command to create flow types for your graphql queries. The types are outputted
in ```private/types/schema.flow.js```

## Pulling API data into the project as Js modules (json) data.

In order to reduce on unnecessary API calls of data that rarelly changes, we have a tool that queries APIs and dumps their data into the project.
> ```npm run pull``` will return page data and some refrence data eg global map themes and place it in various files in the project </br>
> ```npm run visbox``` will get you all visbox data for chart configurations</br>
 These commands should be run at new deployments.


## TODO

---------
- [ ] Reduce service worker pre-cache bundle
- [ ] [Reduce the amount of data we cache with redux persist](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/issues/1600)


## VERY STRANGE BUG

----------

There is this strange bug where a react component willnot be exported out while using export default if its on one line.
i.e
```
  export default connect(mapStateToProps)(MapWithApollo); // this will not export out your component
  // this will work
  const MapWithRedux = connect(mapStateToProps)(MapWithApollo);
  export default MapWithRedux;
```


## Known development issues

----------

- Currently Updating eslint-plugin-react to 7.1.0 will break linting
- eslint@4 is currently not supported, we are wainting for [airbnb eslint config to support it](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/issues/1447)
- Dont install all project wide dependencies with ```yarn``` use ```npm install```. This is because ```yarn``` doesnt care about our semantic.json config that should prevent semantic-ui from auto installing.
- Currently dont add react-apollo flow types. They have an issue that need to be corrected

## Development environment and notes

--------
- we use package.json for some configs, for instance the api link is in package.json's config key.
- module resolution is handled by babel not webpack this is a next.js constraint
- storybook has its own webpack config file you may need to update it where required. It also has a module resolution config.
- Advised to use any modern linux OS or MacOS
- Advised to use NodeJs > 7
